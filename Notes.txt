this helps in fetching request and also handle errors and loading states
function that define the actual code that will be executed that will send the actual request
 is passed to queryFn

Tanstack query handles data error caching and other.
here queryFn is provided with function that returns the promise.
queryKey is used to cache the fetched data to not refetch the data from server every time page reloads
but re-fetched internally and if there is a change in loaded data than that data is silently changed.
array of queryKey is used to check if called queryKey has same key as fetched query key than it gives query's cached data.
isError will work if error is thrown whenever we get error in data fetching function.

Tanstack Query helps to automatically update the data on the ui when any data changes in the backend
also if we move away from the site than a fetch query again will will be sent when we move back to the react application.

disabled is set to searchTerm !== undefined and initial value of searchTerm is undefined so that initially
the find section does not contain anything then when we even if we search find with empty string that shows all events.
